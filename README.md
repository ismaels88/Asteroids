# Asteroids
This program displays a space-ship that dodges asteroids coming from random directions. The user can use the up, down, left, right arrows to manipulate the space-ship. There is also a super speed feature by pressing down on the space bar. Whenever the space-ship collides with an asteroid, the screen will blink red and the space-ship will return to the middle of the screen.
